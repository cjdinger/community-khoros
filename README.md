# Community tools and code

This is a collection of code and components that I have found useful while building and maintaining a Khoros community. (Note: Khoros was formerly Lithium, so some of the terminology reflects the legacy name.)

## Sections

- [SDK tools (Dockerfile for SDK plugin environment)](./sdk)
- [Useful common components - Freemarker code](./components)
